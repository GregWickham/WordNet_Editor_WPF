# WordNet User Interface for WPF

This is a user interface for Wordnet, written on the Windows WPF platform.  It uses a modified version of WordNet for SQL Server, originally created by Michal MÄ›chura.

The SQL Server database that supports this application can be found at [this repo](https://github.com/GregWickham/wordnet-mssql).
